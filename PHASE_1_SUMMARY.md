# Phase 1: Multi-Step Form Foundation - COMPLETED âœ…

## What We Built

### 1. **MultiStepLayout Component** (`app/submit-event/components/MultiStepLayout.tsx`)
- âœ… Progress indicator with 3 steps (Event Details â†’ Select Venues â†’ Send Message)
- âœ… Sticky bottom navigation with Previous/Next buttons
- âœ… Dynamic button text based on current step and state
- âœ… Optional text display for step 2
- âœ… Loading states for form submission
- âœ… Responsive design (mobile + desktop)

### 2. **EventDetailsStep Component** (`app/submit-event/components/EventDetailsStep.tsx`)
- âœ… Complete event form without address fields
- âœ… Image upload with preview and removal
- âœ… Form validation and state management
- âœ… All existing form fields (title, type, date/time, capacity, duration, description, assets, public/private)
- âœ… Proper TypeScript interfaces

### 3. **Placeholder Step Components**
- âœ… **VenueSelectionStep** - Ready for Phase 2 implementation
- âœ… **MessageCompositionStep** - Ready for Phase 3 implementation
- Both include clear phase indicators and feature lists

### 4. **Venue Cart Hook** (`app/submit-event/hooks/useVenueCart.ts`)
- âœ… Session-only state management (no persistence across refresh)
- âœ… Add/remove venues functionality
- âœ… Clear cart and selection checking
- âœ… Venue count tracking

### 5. **Complete Page Rewrite** (`app/submit-event/page.tsx`)
- âœ… Multi-step state management
- âœ… Form data persistence between steps
- âœ… Dynamic navigation logic
- âœ… Proper validation rules
- âœ… Integration with all step components
- âœ… User authentication handling

## Key Features Working

### âœ… **Step Navigation**
- **Step 1 â†’ 2**: Validates required fields (title, date)
- **Step 2 â†’ 3**: Dynamic based on venue selection
  - If venues selected: "Message Spaces (X selected)" â†’ Goes to message step
  - If no venues: "Add Address" â†’ Placeholder for direct creation
- **Step 3**: "Create Event" â†’ Placeholder for API integration

### âœ… **Dynamic UI Elements**
- Progress indicator shows current step with visual completion states
- Button text changes based on context and venue cart state
- Optional text appears in step 2 when no venues selected
- Previous button properly disabled on first step

### âœ… **Form State Management**
- Event data persists when navigating between steps
- Image uploads maintained throughout flow
- Venue cart state independent of form data
- Message state preserved

### âœ… **Validation**
- Step 1: Requires title and date to proceed
- Step 2: Always allows proceeding (venues optional)
- Step 3: Requires message text to submit

## What's Ready for Next Phases

### **Phase 2 Prerequisites** âœ…
- Venue cart hook fully implemented
- VenueSelectionStep component structure ready
- Step navigation logic handles venue selection properly
- Dynamic button text already implemented

### **Phase 3 Prerequisites** âœ…
- MessageCompositionStep component structure ready
- Event data and venue list available to message step
- Form submission flow placeholder in place
- Error handling structure ready

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Navigate to `/submit-event`**
2. **Step 1**: Fill out event details (title required), click "Next"
3. **Step 2**: See placeholder venue selection page, button shows "Add Address"
4. **Step 3**: Would show if venues were selected
5. **Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons work correctly
6. **Validation**: Try submitting without required fields

## Technical Notes

- âœ… No TypeScript errors
- âœ… Maintains existing design system and styling
- âœ… Properly imports all necessary components
- âœ… Session-only state (resets on refresh as requested)
- âœ… Mobile responsive layout
- âœ… Accessibility considerations (form labels, button states)

## Ready for Phase 2! ðŸš€

The foundation is solid and ready for venue selection integration. The next phase will focus on:
1. Integrating with existing explore page components
2. Adding venue selection checkboxes/buttons  
3. Creating the side-sliding venue details popup
4. Implementing proper filtering functionality

All the state management, navigation, and UI structure is in place to support these features seamlessly.
