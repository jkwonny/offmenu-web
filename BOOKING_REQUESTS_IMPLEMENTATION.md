# Booking Requests Dashboard Implementation

## 🎯 Feature Overview
Added a booking requests section to the venue manager dashboard that displays pending requests with clear CTAs for approval/rejection and easy navigation to chat.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Dashboard Integration**
- Added booking requests section above "My Spaces" for urgency
- Shows pending requests only (filtered from all statuses)
- Displays up to 3 requests with "View All" link for more
- Loading states and error handling

### 2. **Request Cards Design**
Each card displays:
- **Sender Info**: Name and request date
- **Venue Details**: Which space they want to book
- **Event Info**: Date and guest count (if available)
- **Message Preview**: Truncated message with "..." 
- **Status Badge**: "Pending" indicator
- **Action Buttons**: Approve/Reject with loading states
- **Chat CTA**: "Chat →" indicator

### 3. **Functionality**
- **Click Card**: Navigate to chat room (`/chat?chatId={room_id}`)
- **Approve/Reject**: Quick action buttons with API calls
- **Loading States**: Spinner during request processing
- **Error Handling**: Alert on API failures
- **Optimistic UI**: Disabled buttons during processing

### 4. **Data Flow**
- Uses existing `useBookingRequests(venueIds)` hook
- Fetches requests for all user's venues
- Filters for pending status only
- Includes all necessary fields: guest_count, message, etc.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

1. **`app/manage/dashboard/page.tsx`**
   - Added booking requests section
   - Implemented request cards with actions
   - Added loading and error states

2. **`app/lib/queries/chat.ts`**
   - Updated `fetchBookingRequests()` to include missing fields
   - Added guest_count, requirements, special_requests, etc.
   - Fixed TypeScript interfaces

### Key Features:
- **Reused Infrastructure**: Leveraged existing hooks and API routes
- **Performance**: Only fetches when user has venues
- **Security**: Uses existing RLS policies
- **UX**: Clear visual hierarchy with urgency indicators

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Visual Hierarchy:
```
🔔 Pending Requests (X)                    [View All →]
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [👤] John Doe                    [Pending]          │
│      Wants to book: Rooftop Lounge                  │
│      📅 Dec 15, 2024 • 👥 25 guests                │
│      💬 "Looking for a birthday..."                 │
│                                                     │
│      [✓ Approve] [✗ Reject]           [💬 Chat →]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Color Scheme:
- **Urgent Red**: `#ca0013` for section header and borders
- **Status Colors**: Yellow for pending, green for approved
- **Action Colors**: Green for approve, red for reject

1. **View Requests**: See all pending booking requests at the top of dashboard
2. **Quick Actions**: Approve or reject directly from cards

4. **Manage Workflow**: Clear visual indicators for urgency

### Navigation Flow:
